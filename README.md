<p>The goal of this project is to demonstrate why ddd models are importants</p>

# Demo use case

A ResourceReferential can onboard new resources.

Each new resource should define a ResourceOwner.

## DDD Steps

Begin by thinking about the model.
```mermaid
---
title: DDD Resource
---
classDiagram
    Aggregate <|-- ResourceReferential
    Aggregate <|-- Resource
    Aggregate <|-- ResourceOwner
    
    Aggregate: +UUID id
    
    class ResourceReferential{
        +UUID defaultResourceOwner
        +String name
        +onboard()
    }
    class Resource {
        +String name
        +boolean active
        +UUID resourceReferentialID
    }
    class ResourceOwner{
        +UUID userId
        +UUID resourceId
    }
```

Why the model ? Because this allows us to support our use cases conceptually.

DO NOT start with the database.<br>
DO NOT start with the clients.

### Aggregates

Aggregate contains *only* pure logic.<br>
They have a state and operations can modify this state.<br>
Any operation that will query the system or update it's state will go through an aggregate. It's a controlled way to go into the system.<br>
This means no update can be done directly in the repository.

*Code demo*

Recap : we created the `ResourceReferential` and the `Resource` class.
There is no persistence yet. The `ResourceOwner` is not created.<br>
We initialized the `Resource` with a default state in a controlled manner.
